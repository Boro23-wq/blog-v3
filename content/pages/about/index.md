Hi!

I'm a senior studying Computer Science. I write blogs on exciting technologies, development and best practice in general. If you're interested in front-end/back-end technologies like me, you might as well check my blog out. Pretty sure you would find something readable.

My blog circumvents around topics related to React, Next, Features, Updates, API's and whole lot development stuff. Make sure to checkout "View all tags" in the Blog page to streamline what you want to read.

If you are down for any suggestions or want to notify about any bug, you can get in touch with me by sending a mail at [sboro2899@gmail.com](mailto:sboro2899@gmail.com). Appreciate your time, cheers!
