Hi!

I'm a senior studying Computer Science. I write blogs on web technologies, development and best practices in general. If you're interested in front-end/back-end technologies like me, you might as well check my blog out. Pretty sure you would find something readable.

My blog circumvents around topics related to Full-stack technologies, features, updates, API's and development at large. I periodically post on Medium too, so if you don't mind checking me out there, you can visit my Medium blog [here](https://sboro2899.medium.com/). And, while you're here make sure to checkout "View all tags" in the Blog page to streamline what you want to read.

If you are down for any suggestions or want to notify about any bug, you can get in touch with me by sending a mail at [sboro2899@gmail.com](mailto:sboro2899@gmail.com). Appreciate your time, cheers!
